### Template Selection

Once requirements are confirmed, the next step is to select an appropriate website template that meets the project's needs. Templates are sourced from ThemeForest based on design aesthetics, responsiveness, and feature compatibility.

- **Selection Process**: Browse ThemeForest for templates that match client preferences identified during the requirement gathering phase. Evaluate templates based on design quality, responsiveness, and included features to ensure they meet project specifications.
- **Client Approval**: Present selected templates to the client for review and approval, ensuring they align with visual and functional expectations. Provide detailed explanations of why each template was chosen to facilitate informed decision-making.

### Template Setup

Upon client approval of the selected template, proceed with the setup to establish a foundational framework for development.

- **Repository Setup**: Create a dedicated repository in the organization's version control system (e.g., GitHub) to manage the project. This ensures that all changes are tracked, and collaboration is streamlined.
- **Template Configuration**: Upload the purchased template to the repository and configure it within the repository structure. Ensure that all necessary files and assets are correctly organized and accessible.
- **Environment Setup**: Set up the initial project environment and dependencies as specified by the template documentation. This includes configuring build tools, package managers, and any required plugins or extensions.
- **Development Tools Installation**: Install required development tools and libraries to support local development environments. Ensure that all team members have the necessary tools and configurations to work effectively.
- **Initial Testing**: Verify the setup by running initial tests to ensure compatibility and functionality. This step helps identify and resolve any setup issues before development begins.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed setup documentation within the repository. This documentation should include setup instructions, dependencies, and configuration details to assist current and future team members.

By following these steps, you ensure a smooth transition from template selection to setup, providing a solid foundation for the development phase. This structured approach helps streamline the development process, reduces setup errors, and aligns the project with client expectations.
