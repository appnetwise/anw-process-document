## 3. Initial Planning

### Requirement Gathering

The success of any website project begins with a clear understanding of client requirements. This phase involves:

- **Client Consultation**: Conduct meetings and discussions with stakeholders to define project goals, target audience, branding guidelines, and specific functional requirements.
- **Documentation**: Document requirements using tools like Google Docs or Confluence to ensure clarity and alignment with client expectations.
- **Feedback and Confirmation**: Seek client feedback and approval on gathered requirements to proceed to the next phase.
