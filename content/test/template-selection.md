### Template Selection

Once requirements are confirmed, the next step is to select an appropriate website template that meets the project's needs. Templates are sourced from ThemeForest based on design aesthetics, responsiveness, and feature compatibility.

- **Selection Process**: Browse ThemeForest for templates that match client preferences identified during requirement gathering.
- **Client Approval**: Present selected templates to the client for review and approval, ensuring they align with visual and functional expectations.

### Template Purchase and Setup

Upon client approval of the selected template, proceed with the purchase and setup to establish a foundational framework for development.

- **Purchase**: Complete the purchase of the chosen template on ThemeForest, ensuring all necessary licenses and documentation are obtained.
- **Repository Setup**: Create a dedicated repository in the organization's version control system (e.g., GitHub).
- **Upload the purchased template and configure it within the repository structure**.
- **Set up initial project environment and dependencies as specified by the template documentation**.
- **Install required development tools and libraries to support local development environments**.
- **Verify setup by running initial tests to ensure compatibility and functionality**.
