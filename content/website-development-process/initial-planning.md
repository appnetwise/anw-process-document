### Requirement Gathering

The success of any website project begins with a clear understanding of client requirements. This phase involves:

- **Client Consultation**: Conduct thorough meetings and discussions with stakeholders to define project goals, target audience, branding guidelines, and specific functional requirements. This step ensures that all parties are aligned and any ambiguities are clarified early on.
- **Documentation**: Document all gathered requirements using collaborative tools like Google Docs or Confluence. This documentation serves as a reference point throughout the project, ensuring that the development team and the client have a clear and agreed-upon roadmap.
- **Feedback and Confirmation**: Present the documented requirements to the client for feedback. This iterative process involves refining the requirements based on client input and obtaining formal approval to proceed to the next phase. This step is crucial for preventing misunderstandings and ensuring client satisfaction.
