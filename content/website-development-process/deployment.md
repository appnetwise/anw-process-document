### Deployment Process

Deploy the website using GitHub Pages for public access, following best practices to ensure smooth deployment and maintenance.

- **GitHub Pages Setup**: Configure GitHub Pages to host the website directly from the project repository.
  - Ensure proper configuration of custom domains if required.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Implement continuous deployment workflows using GitHub Actions or similar tools to automate the deployment process.
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring tools to track deployment status and performance post-deployment.
